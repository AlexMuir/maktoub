  Maktoub.twitter_url = "http://twitter.com/#!/twitter" # your twitter page

  Maktoub.subscription_preferences_url = "http://example.com/manage_subscriptions" #subscribers management url
  Maktoub.logo = "logo.jpg" # path to your logo asset
  Maktoub.home_domain = "example.com" # your domain
  Maktoub.app_name = "Maktoub" # your app name

  # pass a block to subscribers_extractor that returns an object that  reponds to :name and :email 
  # (fields can be configure as shown below)
  require "ostruct"
  Maktoub.subscribers_extractor do
    users = []
    (1..5).each do |i|
      users << OpenStruct.new({name: "tester#{i}", email: "test#{i}@example.com"})
    end
    return users
  end

  # uncomment lines below to change subscriber fields that contain email and 
  # Maktoub.email_field = :address 
  # Maktoub.name_field = :nickname

=== Authoring

Create a newsletter as a normal view partial in app/views/maktoub/newsletters/. 
The subject of the newsletter will be automatically deduced from the partial's name.

=== View in browser
To be able to view your newsletter in a browser add it to routes.rb.
  # mount the engine at a path of your choice. 
  # you would access the newsletter at: http://example.com/newsletter/my_awesome_newletter
  mount Maktoub::Engine => "/"
